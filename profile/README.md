# The key to empowered developers
We create healthy environments for developers, empowering them to boost efficiency and grow business.

## What we do ‚öôÔ∏è
Our main focus is to deliver business-oriented solutions that streamline developer processes. These resources effectively minimize disruptions caused by context switching and contribute to an educational environment enriched with advanced security measures, standardized processes, reusable components, and comprehensive traceability.

### Platform Engineering
Platforms are a great way to streamline development workflows, since they enforce common company standards, *ways of working*, and best practices that ensures that everyone is moving in the same direction.

### Accelerate
Fast feedback loops are essential to achieve velocity and efficiency.

Both inner loop (local and dev environments) and outer loop (CI/CD, preview environments, customer feedback collection) are crucial and can be accelerated.

### Developer Efficiency Assessment
By examining your team and your organization, you get an insight of what's exactly happening and how to perform better in the three velocity pillars: **technology, working practices & organizational enablement**
