# Welcome to DevXP's organization üöÄ

DevXP is a consultancy focused in optimizing and streamlining developers' experience on their day to day work.

## What we do ‚öôÔ∏è
We help you improve developer efficiency by empowering the team with the right set of tools and working practices.

Our three main focus areas are: 

### Developer Efficiency Assessment
By examining your team and your organization, you get an insight of what's exactly happening and how to perform better in the three velocity pillars: **technology, working practices & organizational enablement**

### Feedback Loop Acceleration
Fast feedback loops are essential to achieve velocity and efficiency.

Both inner loop (local and dev environments) and outer loop (CI/CD, preview environments, customer feedback collection) are crucial and can be accelerated.


### Platform Engineering
Platforms are a great way to streamline development workflows, since they enforce common company standards, *ways of working*, and best practices that ensures that everyone is moving in the same direction.
